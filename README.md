# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer
## This is a project of a sorting algorithm visualizer made in react. It's my first ever react project
It features 3 algorithms: bubble sort, insertion sort and selection sort. Quick sort was another sorting algorithm that I was going to implement, but I gave up due to the complexity I had with setting states in the quick sort, which is a recursive function.
